<em>Hey there, everyone! Following our revision upgrade, it afforded us the opportunity to begin implementing some of the new interfaces and tweak them in a way we think will work best for the server. Over the next short while, we're going to be experimenting with adding these interfaces into the game in an organic way and are very excited to get it working. Besides the interface exploration, we've got a handful of varying adjustments and fixes for you all in this patch.

<em>Thanks!
