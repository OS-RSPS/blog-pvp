<em>Hey there, everyone! Once again, just a minor patch, but we've introduced a ton of new tasks for Fremennik and will potentially have more coming (we've got our eye on this area at the moment); we've also made some changes to ironman drop functionality, changed up some more emblem rates, and made some minor QOL improvements across the board.

<em>Thanks!

- Removed restrictions on Ironman players receiving drops from monsters. This means Ironmen can now PvM with their friends and receive drops normally. 
- The amount of emblem charge gained from Mining, Fishing and Woodcutting actions now scales with the amount of resources collected from that action. For example, if the logs you chop get doubled by the emblem effect, you will also receive double charge for that action.
- Catching Anglerfish in the Wilderness now grants 11 charge, up from 1.
- Catching Infernal eels in the Wilderness now grants 9 charge, up from 7.
