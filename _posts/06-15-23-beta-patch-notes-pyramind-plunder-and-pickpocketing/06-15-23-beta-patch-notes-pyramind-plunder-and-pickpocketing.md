<em>Hey there, everyone! Having just recently pushed a bunch of changes to thieving, we figured it was about time we bring some of the related minigames up to spec. With this small patch, we've got a fair few changes to how Pyramid Plunder is going to be managed, alongside some pretty critical system changes regarding the performance of tasks.

<em>Thanks!

- Fixed any size bag of riches obtained from pyramid plunder counting towards massive bag tasks.
