<em>Hey there, everyone! We're very excited to share something we've been working on for awhile now; introducing: our first custom miniquest, The Lunar Clan. This quest will be a requirement for players who wish to unlock access to Lunar magics, and completing it will also unlock a custom title. We've also introduced a handful of new tasks to go alongside this questline and a bunch of separate fixes and content pushes for the server. 

<em>Thanks!

<em>Neox Staff<br>
