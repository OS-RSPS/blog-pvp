<em>Hey there, everyone! As we continue to play through the server and experiment with the different rates, as well as receive feedback throughout the beta phase, we've come to understand that some of the rates need adjustments! With this patch, we're looking to make things feel a little more balanced for the game, as well as push through some changes to the website for clarity's sake and overall just improve the look of the hiscores. We're quite excited to share this with you all (most specifically our iron man testees; it's about time you got some recognition)!

<em>Thanks!

<em>Neox Staff<br>

- We've made some changes to the Resource Bag:
  - Added an option to destroy all the items inside the resource bag.
  - Added a button in the top right corner of the bank interface that allows you to instantly deposit all the contents of your looting bag and resource bag (if they are in your inventory).
  - The deposit loot button in the bank deposit box interface now also deposits resource bag contents, and its sprite has changed to a resource bag.
  - The following items can now be deposited into the resource bag:
    - All types of bones.
    - All types of hides.
    - All cooked food.
    - All metal bars.
    - All hunter trap loot.
    - All bird nests (whether empty or filled).
- We've rebalanced some of the resource item weights (as a reminder, this affects how many items can fit in the bag):
  - Pure essence: 0.002kg -> 0.02kg
  - Coal: 2.267kg -> 0.3kg
  - Clay: 1kg -> 0.5kg
  - Tin, Copper, Iron, Mithril, Adamantite ores: 2.267kg -> 0.8kg
  - Silver and gold ore: 2.267kg -> 0.5kg
  - Runite ore: 2.267kg -> 1.2kg
  - Logs: 2kg -> 0.5kg
  - Oak, Willow, Teak, Mahogany logs: 2kg -> 0.5kg
  - Yew logs: 2kg -> 0.6kg

  - Tier 1: +10kg
  - Tier 2: +15kg
  - Tier 3: +20kg
  - Tier 4: +30kg
  - Tier 5: +40kg
- Mining has directly undergone several QOL adjustments as well:

  - The amount of essence mined per action now scales with level and pickaxe used. At 99 with a dragon pickaxe, you can mine up to 10 pure essence per action.
  - The Dragon pickaxe and all of its variants now have a 1/6 chance to speed up the mining action by 1 tick.
  - Core ore rocks no longer deplete after every ore mined, instead, they only have a chance to deplete.

- "All" clue scroll counter will now log to hiscores correctly.
- The hiscores now properly shows the voting category.
