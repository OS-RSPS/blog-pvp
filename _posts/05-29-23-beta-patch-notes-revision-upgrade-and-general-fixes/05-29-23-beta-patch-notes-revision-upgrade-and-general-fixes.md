<em>Hey there, everyone! We have some very exciting news this time around and it's that we've upgraded revisions! For those who're unaware, that basically implies that we have a more updated version of the osrs cache which in turn allows us access to the newest content they've pushed including Bounty Hunter (though we'll be approaching this in the future for now). With that, there's the chance that a fair few things may have broken, so we'll be spending the next while thoroughly testing everything to make sure it's still smoothly operating as well as continuing to fix any discovered bugs and introduce more content. Thanks, and stay tuned!

<em>Thanks!

<em>Neox Staff<br>
