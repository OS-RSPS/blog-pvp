Alongside some miscellaneous adjustments, a variety of reported issues have been addressed and we've made some adjustments to the achievement system.

<em>Thanks!

- Added 5 new Kandarin area achievements and rewards.
- The coal trucks area has been reworked and introduced.
- The coal trucks themselves can now be interacted with to instantly deposit all coal you're carrying directly to your bank, including from your resource bag and coal bag, if you're carrying them. The dwarf Stankers will only allow you to use the trucks if you've completed the 'Kandarin Citizen' achievement.
- There are now 2 concentrated coal rocks at the coal trucks area. As with the Wilderness versions, these rocks never deplete, but require 70 Mining. Mining these rocks also requires completion of the 'Kandarin Noble' achievement.
- Added more regular rock spawns at the coal trucks area in a 3-rock formation for easier Mining.
- Added a coal trucks teleport to the main teleport portal.
