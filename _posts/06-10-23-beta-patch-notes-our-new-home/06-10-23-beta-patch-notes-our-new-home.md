<em>Hey there, everyone! After some serious back and forth with the community and with our map developer, we're finally ready to port the new home into the server and begin plugging it in. Over the next short while, we're going to be moving all server assets onto the new home design and asking for your feedback in where to place things and how it feels overall. We're very excited for this new iteration of the map as we genuinely believes it affords us a tremendous opportunity to introduce some really exciting elements to the server down the road (such as localized unique random events or questlines). Bear with us while we smooth everything out over the next couple of days regarding the new home, but for now... here's the most recent patch notes.

<em>Thanks!

<em>Neox Staff<br>
